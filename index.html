<h1>Emily's Portfolio</h1>
<img src="images/IMG_1578.JPG" width="400px" alt="Emily stands in front of the Unisphere in a superhero pose with hands on hips, wearing protective skating gear including helmet, knee pads, and wrist guards. She looks confident and energetic. The scene is outdoors in a park with trees, a fountain, and people relaxing and walking nearby. The sky is partly cloudy, giving the environment a bright and open feeling." >
<p> I think of art as a form of expression in order to show to others what the world looks like through my eyes. 
    I am not the best person when it comes to verbal expression. No matter how I phrase it, in my head there's always a better way it could've come out. 
    Drawing, fashion, and film are some of the visual ways I am able to reflect on my thoughts. 
    Being able to physically see what is in my head come to life at my hands feels magical. 
    This magical feeling is what drives and inspires me to create meticulous pieces of work to show the world. 
    Every little detail is significant in contributing to the overall being of my art.
  </p>
<p> The purposefulness of my art comes from my own life. In realizing that the space I take up in the real world is significant. 
    This enables me to express the ability I have to do so many things that can impact the world for the better. 
    What I want to convey through my work is a more positive/optimistic outlook on life. 
    Whether it's a comedic aspect in a grim situation, or an escape from the familiarity of reality through the added magic of special effects. 
    I spent half my life inside my own head, and my own world. 
    As I grow, explore, and communicate with others; I realize that my world isn't the only one. 
    I want to show others what took me years to realize, in the language that I know best to do it in; Film and media.</p>
