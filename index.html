  <h1> Emily Vargas's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
  <p>I think of art as a form of expression in order to show to others what the world looks like through my eyes. 
    I am not the best person when it comes to verbal expression. No matter how I phrase it, in my head; there's always a better way. It could've come out of it.
    Drawing, fashion, and film are some of the visual ways I am able to reflect on my thoughts.
    Being able to physically see what is in my head come to life at my hands feels magical.
    This magical feeling is what drives and inspires me to create meticulous pieces of work to show the world.</p>
