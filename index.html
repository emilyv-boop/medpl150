  <h1> Emily Vargas's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
  <p>I think of art as a form of expression in order to show to others what the world looks like through my eyes. 
    I am not the best persom when it comes to virbal expression. No mater how I phrase it, in my head; theres always a better way It could've come out it.
    Drawing, fashion, and film are some of the visual ways I am able to reflect on my thoughts.
    Being able to physically see what is in my head come to life at my hands feels magical.
    This magical feeling is what drives and inspires me to create meticulus pieces of work to show the world.</p>
